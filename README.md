# Brute-Fork
This is a brute forcing application designed to study how pentesting tools are made.
Do not use this code for illegal activity.
It isn't even a particularily good brute forcer.
You may need to download Firefox to run it (based on my personal preference).
Once it is running, there is a step by step guide to help you navigate your attack point.

This app was designed to be easy enough for a cave man to use.
